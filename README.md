# ottopolis

A basic Flutter project to implement the learnings I have taken from Bloc, Unit Testing using bloc and setting up CI/CD pipeline using Codemagic.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
